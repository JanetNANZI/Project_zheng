## Research Proposal
### 1. Goal: question

### 2. What data you can get to answer this question (can your data anwer your questions?)
### If not, what other data you need to construct on your own (from different sources) in order to answer your questions

Background: Hurricane Florence brought heavy precipitation and flooding in North Carolina in September 2018. One of the biggest impacts is that the outbreak of “mosquito-pocalypse”, as coined by USA TODAY, dramatically increases the risk of the mosquitos-borne diseases. Dengue fever, which often causes serious bleeding and even death, is one type of these diseases. In the past decade, it has been spreading rapidly in tropical climates where large amounts of mosquitos breed. A growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce this distributional shift, resulting in significant public health problems worldwide, as indicated, for instance, by reports of billions of huge “Gallinippers” mosquitoes following Hurricane Florence”. 

Purpose: In this paper, I would like to use the dengue dataset available for San Juan, Puerto Rico to analyze the relationship between climate conditions and increase in mosquito populations, which, as a result, increase the potential of related illnesses. Firstly, I will conduct correlation tests to see how the different local climate variables are related to the weekly dengue fever cases. Secondly, I will divide weekly the dengue cases into three (3) groups, based on the potential level for an outbreak to occur. I will then run classification models to test and compare how well they classify these three groups of outbreak risk level. Thirdly, I will use regression models to examine how well they predict the number of weekly dengue cases and select the most effective method for potential use by public health officials to take preventive action as needed. 

Data: The dataset contains 936 sampled weeks reporting the total weekly number of dengue cases from 1999 to 2008 in San Juan, Puerto Rico with its corresponding climate data. I found the dataset at Kaggle, a platform containing public datasets. However, the data originally comes from multiple sources: dengue surveillance data is provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides climate data. The covariates I will use for this paper mainly include around18 climate attributes (such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and vegetation) and the weekly dengue cases as the outcome variable (label).
